# Network Hardening Risk Assessment Report

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate (Course 3). It presents a data breach scenario at a social media company and tasks the analyst with identifying and implementing appropriate network hardening techniques to prevent future attacks.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- Security risk analysis
- Network vulnerability mitigation
- Implementation of firewalls and access controls
- MFA deployment planning
- NIST-compliant password policy recommendations
- Professional technical documentation

---

## 🔍 Key Vulnerabilities Identified
- Employees were sharing passwords
- Default admin password was not changed
- No firewall rules in place to monitor traffic
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA) was not implemented

---

## 🛡️ Recommended Hardening Techniques
1. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** – Blocks unauthorized logins even if passwords are stolen.
2. **Firewall Maintenance + Port Filtering** – Reduces attack surface by monitoring traffic and blocking vulnerable ports.
3. **Password Policies (NIST-compliant)** – Enforces strong, unique, and secure passwords; prevents use of defaults.

## 🧾 Files Included
- `Network_Risk_Assessment_Report.pdf` – Final report with vulnerabilities, solutions, and explanations.
- *(Optional)* `hardening_methods_summary.txt` – Additional notes on tool effectiveness and scheduling.

---

## 🎯 Objective
This project demonstrates how to identify weaknesses in a network and apply practical, industry-relevant hardening techniques. It highlights your ability to assess real-world scenarios and recommend reliable, ongoing security practices.
